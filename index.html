  <h4> Flights </h4>
<p>
Over the last few years, christmas in Lagos has become a staple for Young Africans around the globe and airlines have been paying attention. There are direct flights coming from BA and Virgin Atlantic, which if not booked months in advance can really hurt a pocket. However, there are plenty of indirect options that feature transfer periods of 1-10 hours, depending on the specific route you take. These airlines include KLM, Air France, Turkish Airlines and Emirates.

<h4> Accommodation </h4>
<p>
Every Nigerian knows the hustling that is required to find accommodation during this very busy period. So naturally, staying with friends and family is the preferred situation. However, if this is not an option, hotels and AirBnbs are definitely good second options. Some popular hotels include Eko Hotel, Oriental Hotel and Radisson Blu Hotel.
