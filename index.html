<h2> Brussels </h2>

<h4> Getting there </h4>
You can get to Brussels by plane, but if you can afford to, the Eurostar is better. I took the Eurostar for just under a £100 per person in June this year. Much calmer than a flight, and with less severe security. The vibe was altogether much calmer than other trips abroad that I’d been on.
<h4> Activities </h4>
<ul>
  <li> The Grand Place </li>
<li> Days out to Bruges </li>
<li> Atomium </li>
</ul>

<h4> Food and drinks </h4>
<p> My favourite place to drink and hang out is Le Cercueil, although it is slightly pricey if you are on a small budget. The bar is perfect for anyone who wants to go somewhere different and alternative; anyone interested in goth, punk, rock, or anything out of the ordinary will like this.

<h2> Lagos </h2>

  <h4> Getting there </h4>
<p>
Over the last few years, christmas in Lagos has become a staple for Young Africans around the globe and airlines have been paying attention. There are direct flights coming from BA and Virgin Atlantic, which if not booked months in advance can really hurt a pocket. However, there are plenty of indirect options that feature transfer periods of 1-10 hours, depending on the specific route you take. These airlines include KLM, Air France, Turkish Airlines and Emirates.

<h4> Accommodation </h4>
<p>
Every Nigerian knows the hustling that is required to find accommodation during this very busy period. So naturally, staying with friends and family is the preferred situation. However, if this is not an option, hotels and AirBnbs are definitely good second options. Some popular hotels include Eko Hotel, Oriental Hotel and Radisson Blu Hotel.
